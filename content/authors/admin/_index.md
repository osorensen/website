I am an associate professor of statistics at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](https://www.oslobrains.no/) (LCBC). At LCBC I'm involved in many exciting projects aimed at understanding how the human brain and cognitive function develop over the lifespan, and how they're affect by other variables like sleep, genetic variations, and demographics. My methodological work is inspired these applications, with the goal of developing analysis methods and software for analyzing complex longitudinal data.

This website summarizes my main statistical publications and research software. Click on the icons to the left to see my full publication list in Google Scholar and all my software projects at GitHub. Visit the [LCBC homepage](https://www.oslobrains.no/) to learn more about the research we're doing.
