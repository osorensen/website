I am a statistician and R programmer working as Associate Professor at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](https://www.oslobrains.no/) (LCBC) at the University of Oslo. 

I did my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Oslo with [Magne Thoresen](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/groups/measurement-error-modeling/index.html) and [Arnoldo Frigessi](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/people/aca/frigessi/index.html). Prior to joining LCBC, I worked for 3.5 years as an industry data scientist, the last two years at [NextBridge Analytics](http://nextbridge.no/nextbridge-analytics/). An up-to-date list of my publications are available at my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=neOqbw0AAAAJ&hl=no), and my R packages can be found at my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/osorensen/).
