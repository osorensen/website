The organizers of the [European R User Meeting 2020](https://2020.erum.io/) have put together a really impressive event, with lots of opportunities for interaction and stimulating discussions while being fully online. I have particularly enjoyed the good mix of academic presentations focusing on methodology and more business and industry related presentations focusing on use of R in production.

Today I presented the `BayesMallows` package in a five-minute lightning talk, and the slides (with links) are available [here](https://osorensen.github.io/ERUM2020/BayesMallows/presentation.html). Recordings of all the talks will be posted in the [ERUM 2020 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDOoQShiQHE7_C-wuLqFJ7w).
