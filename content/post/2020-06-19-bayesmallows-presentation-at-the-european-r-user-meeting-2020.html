<p>The organizers of the <a href="https://2020.erum.io/">European R User Meeting 2020</a> have put together a really impressive event, with lots of opportunities for interaction and stimulating discussions while being fully online. I have particularly enjoyed the good mix of academic presentations focusing on methodology and more business and industry related presentations focusing on use of R in production.</p>
<p>Today I presented the <code>BayesMallows</code> package in a five-minute lightning talk, and the slides (with links) are available <a href="https://osorensen.github.io/ERUM2020/BayesMallows/presentation.html">here</a>. Recordings of all the talks will be posted in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDOoQShiQHE7_C-wuLqFJ7w">ERUM 2020 YouTube channel</a>.</p>
