The [European R User Meeting 2020](https://2020.erum.io/) has so far been a really great event, with interesting talks and online presentations working smoothly. I presented the [metagam](https://lifebrain.github.io/metagam/) package this morning, and the slides are available [here](https://osorensen.github.io/ERUM2020/metagam/metagam.html).
