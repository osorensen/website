<p>In preparing for my upcoming Rcpp talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/events/256805098/">Oslo useR! Group</a>, I started wondering how much of R is actually written in C or Fortran. I have of course been trained to think that vectorization is great, because then you let C or Fortran do the job, but how much of R is actually written in these languages? Some searching led me to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142342/http://librestats.com/2011/08/27/how-much-of-r-is-written-in-r/">this blog</a>, which analyzes R-2.13.1. However, that post is from 2011, and at the time of writing R has reached version 3-5.2. In addition, the post uses Bash scripts rather than R itself. In this post, I hence reexamine the question, using R all the way, which will be a good exercise. Note that this analysis covers the functions in <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html">base R</a>, i.e., stuff like <code>apply()</code>, <code>data.frame()</code>, <code>plot()</code>, and (I guess, but really have no idea) the code that actually makes R run.</p>
<p>I start by defining the R version I want, and the path to which the source file should be saved.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r_version &lt;- &quot;3.5.2&quot;
tarfile &lt;- paste0(&quot;./R-&quot;, r_version, &quot;.tar.gz&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then I download the source:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(url = paste0(&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-&quot;, 
                           r_version, &quot;.tar.gz&quot;),
              destfile = tarfile)</code></pre>
<p>Having downloaded it, I unpack the tar file and remove it. We now have a R-3.5.2 directory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>untar(tarfile)
file.remove(tarfile)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>I also define the path to the source code, which is in the <code>src</code> subdirectory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(src_path &lt;- paste0(&quot;./R-&quot;, r_version, &quot;/src/&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;./R-3.5.2/src/&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In order to see which files are in <code>src</code>, I list all files that end with a <code>.</code> followed by alphanumeric characters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>files &lt;- list.files(src_path, pattern = &quot;\\.[[:alnum:]]+$&quot;, recursive = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Next, I take a first look at all the file endings under <code>src</code>. As we can see, the main languages are C (<code>.c</code>), Fortran (<code>.f</code>) and R (<code>.R</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stringr)
(file_count &lt;- table(str_extract(files, &quot;\\.[:alnum:]+$&quot;)))</code></pre>

<p>I now count the number of lines in each C, Fortran, and R file. I use the <code>map</code> function from <code>purrr</code>, which is part of the tidyverse. The pattern <code>"\\.[c|f|R]$"</code> means <em>everything that ends with a period followed by c, f or R</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(R.utils) # For countLines

stats &lt;- str_subset(files, &quot;\\.[c|f|R]$&quot;) %&gt;% 
  split(str_extract(., &quot;\\.[c|f|R]$&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  map_dfr(function(x){
  tibble(
    Lines = sum(map_int(x, ~ countLines(paste0(src_path, .x)))),
    Files = length(x)
  )
    }, .id = &quot;Language&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    Language = recode(Language, `.c` = &quot;C&quot;, `.f` = &quot;Fortran&quot;, `.R` = &quot;R&quot;),
    LinesPct = paste(100 * round(Lines / sum(Lines), 2), &quot;%&quot;),
    FilesPct = paste(100 * round(Files / sum(Files), 2), &quot;%&quot;)
    )</code></pre>
<p>We now have the required numbers, and can make a plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(stats, aes(x = Language, y = Lines, label = LinesPct)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = &quot;white&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Number of lines per language in base R&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>So, the conclusion is that most of base R is written in C or Fortran, at least in terms of lines of code. This is of course good, because it lets us write fast code, e.g., through vectorization.</p>
<p>The number of files per language was shown above, but we can plot this as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(stats, aes(x = Language, y = Files, label = FilesPct)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = &quot;white&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Number of lines per language in base R&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It seems like there are some really long files with Fortran code in there!</p>
<p>Finally I delete the R source code which was downloaded.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>unlink(paste0(&quot;./R-&quot;, r_version), recursive = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>An interesting follow-up would be to study how this has changed over time, and also for CRAN packages.</p>
