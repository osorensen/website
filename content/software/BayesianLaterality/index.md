Functional differences between the cerebral hemispheres are a fundamental characteristic of the human brain. Researchers interested in studying these differences often infer underlying hemispheric dominance for a certain function (e.g., language) from laterality indices calculated from observed performance or brain activation measures. However, any inference from observed measures to latent (unobserved) classes has to consider the prior probability of class membership in the population. The provided functions implement a Bayesian model for predicting hemispheric dominance from observed laterality indices.
