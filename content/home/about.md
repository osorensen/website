# Biography

I am an associate professor of statistics at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](http://www.oslobrains.no) at the University of Oslo. Here I work with great brain scientist who have large longitudinal datasets that require lots of interesting statistical methodology. I have also developed R packages, worked with measurement error modeling, and Bayesian modeling of preference data.
