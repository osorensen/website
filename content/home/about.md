# Biography

I am an Associate Professor in Statistics at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](http://www.oslobrains.no) at the University of Oslo. I do both methodological and applied work related to analysis of neuroimaging data, and I'm particularly interested in statistical methodology for analyzing how changes in the brain are related to changes in cognition, and genetic and environmental factors. I have also developed several R packages, and I'm currently an associate editor of the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).
