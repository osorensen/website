      <description>In a previous post, I briefly described the Lasso, and my plan for implementing it in twelve languages in 2019. To start out easily, and have a reference, I am beginning with R. The rules are do not use external dependencies, i.e., no calls to library(). This is obviously not how we we do it in real life, but my goal is just to get some practice. (That being said, anyone who has tried to convince an IT department in a large corporation to install R packages, knows the value of base).</description>

      <description>During the holidays, I finally took the time to read The Pragmatic Programmer. The book inspired me to learn some new programming languages, so in 2019, I am going to implement Tibshirani’s lasso in twelve different languages, some of which I know very well, and others in which I have never even said hello world. This post is a warm-up, in which I am going to give a brief introduction to the lasso and show how it can be computed very conveniently using the glmnet package.</description>
