      <description>The organizers of the European R User Meeting 2020 have put together a really impressive event, with lots of opportunities for interaction and stimulating discussions while being fully online. I have particularly enjoyed the good mix of academic presentations focusing on methodology and more business and industry related presentations focusing on use of R in production.
Today I presented the BayesMallows package in a five-minute lightning talk, and the slides (with links) are available here.</description>

      <title>In Which Language is R Written?</title>

      <description>In preparing for my upcoming Rcpp talk at the Oslo useR! Group, I started wondering how much of R is actually written in C or Fortran. I have of course been trained to think that vectorization is great, because then you let C or Fortran do the job, but how much of R is actually written in these languages? Some searching led me to this blog, which analyzes R-2.13.1. However, that post is from 2011, and at the time of writing R has reached version 3-5.</description>
